#Two week ted talk

This was a overnight project made with my roommate. We created a place to write determinations and share them with friends. The idea was built and left alone.

#On the horizon

In the future, this should have a count down messaging system. The user who posts a determination will set a time period. The time period will begin a countdown after their post is made. Once the countdown is completed, another member who has posted will be informed to contact the other person.
